If EZY_Booking_OLD.apk won't install, here's how to fix it:

========================================

STEP 3: Use Chrome Browser Method

1. Email the APK to yourself
2. Open email on phone using Chrome
3. Download the APK through Chrome
4. Chrome will ask for install permission
5. Enable it and install

========================================
      ALTERNATIVE INSTALLATION METHODS

========================================
        COMMON ERROR MESSAGES
========================================

"App not installed" - Usually permissions issue
Solution: Try Chrome browser method above

"Package installer has stopped" - Corrupted APK
Solution: Re-download the APK file

"Installation blocked" - Security settings
Solution: Enable unknown sources for your browser

"Parsing error" - Incompatible APK
Solution: This means we definitely need the new APK

========================================
         WHAT ANDROID VERSION?
========================================

Check your Android version:
Settings â†’ About Phone â†’ Android Version

Android 5-10: Old APK should work fine
Android 11-14: Needs special installation steps above

========================================
           QUICK DIAGNOSIS

Tell me:
1. What Android version do you have?

========================================
          IF NOTHING WORKS
========================================

Don't worry! This confirms we need the new improved APK.
The installation issues are exactly why I updated the code
for Android 11+ compatibility.

Let's focus on getting the GitHub auto-build working
since that will give you an APK that installs properly
on modern Android versions.
