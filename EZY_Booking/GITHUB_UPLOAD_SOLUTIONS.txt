========================================
     GITHUB UPLOAD SOLUTIONS
========================================

GitHub web interface has 100 file limit.
Here are easy ways around this:

========================================
  SOLUTION 1: UPLOAD ONLY SOURCE CODE
========================================

Don't upload the ENTIRE folder. Only upload these:

INCLUDE (Upload these folders/files):
✅ app/src/
✅ app/build.gradle
✅ build.gradle
✅ settings.gradle
✅ gradle.properties
✅ gradle/wrapper/
✅ gradlew
✅ gradlew.bat
✅ keystore/

EXCLUDE (Don't upload these):
❌ app/build/ (build outputs - huge!)
❌ .gradle/ (cache - huge!)
❌ .idea/ (IDE files)
❌ *.iml files
❌ local.properties

This reduces from 1000+ files to about 50 files.

========================================
  SOLUTION 2: CREATE ZIP AND UPLOAD
========================================

1. Right-click your EZY_Booking folder
2. Create ZIP file
3. Upload the ZIP to GitHub
4. GitHub will extract it automatically

========================================
  SOLUTION 3: USE GITHUB DESKTOP
========================================

1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Install it (easier than command line)
3. Sign in with your GitHub account
4. Click "Add an existing repository"
5. Select your EZY_Booking folder
6. Click "Publish repository"
7. It handles all files automatically!

========================================
  SOLUTION 4: ONLINE BUILD SERVICES
========================================

Since GitHub is being difficult, try these:

A) CircleCI (Free tier)
   - Upload project
   - Automatic Android builds

B) Bitrise (Free tier)
   - Drag and drop project
   - Professional Android builds

C) CodeMagic (Free tier)
   - Specifically for mobile apps

========================================
     SOLUTION 5: CLEAN YOUR PROJECT
========================================

Before uploading anywhere, clean your project:

1. Delete these folders:
   - app/build/
   - .gradle/
   - .idea/

2. Delete these files:
   - *.iml
   - local.properties

This removes 90% of the files!

========================================
       MY RECOMMENDATION
========================================

TRY THIS ORDER:

1. FIRST: Clean your project (Solution 5)
2. THEN: Try ZIP upload (Solution 2)
3. IF THAT FAILS: Use GitHub Desktop (Solution 3)
4. LAST RESORT: Online build service (Solution 4)

========================================
          STEP-BY-STEP CLEANUP
========================================

Let's clean your project right now:

1. Go to C:\Users\Dell\EZY_Booking\
2. Delete folder: app\build\
3. Delete folder: .gradle\
4. Delete folder: .idea\
5. Delete any .iml files
6. Delete local.properties (if exists)

NOW your project will have ~50 files instead of 1000+

Then try uploading to GitHub again!

========================================
           ALTERNATIVE: ZIP METHOD
========================================

If cleanup still leaves too many files:

1. Right-click EZY_Booking folder
2. Send to → Compressed folder
3. Upload the ZIP file to GitHub
4. GitHub extracts it automatically

This bypasses the file count limit!
