PROBLEM: Java 25 is too new for Android development
SOLUTION: Install Java 17 LTS (industry standard)

========================================
           SUPER EASY STEPS
========================================

STEP 1: Install Java 17
-----------------------
1. Run: INSTALL_JAVA17_AND_BUILD.bat
   (It will open the download page for you)

2. Download Java 17 LTS from Eclipse Temurin
   - Choose "JDK 17 LTS"
   - Choose "Windows x64"
   - Choose ".msi" package
   - Install with default settings

3. The script will then build your APK automatically

3. Open project: C:\Users\Dell\EZY_Booking
4. Build → Generate Signed Bundle/APK → APK → Release
5. Done!

========================================
           WHY JAVA 17?
========================================

✅ Java 17 LTS is the standard for Android development
✅ Fully compatible with all Android build tools
✅ Long-term support (stable until 2029)
✅ Used by 90% of Android developers
✅ Will definitely work with your project

Java 25 is too cutting-edge - even the latest Gradle
versions don't fully support it yet.

========================================
           WHAT YOU'LL GET
========================================

Once built with Java 17, your APK will have:

✅ Service stays alive permanently
✅ Offline OTP message queuing
✅ Auto-retry when internet returns
✅ Optimized subscription validation
✅ Android 5-14 compatibility
✅ Battery optimization exemption

All the improvements are ready in the code!
