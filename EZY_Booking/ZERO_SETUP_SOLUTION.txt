========================================
        ZERO SETUP SOLUTION
========================================

I understand nothing is working. Let's try the
SIMPLEST possible approach with ZERO local setup.

========================================
   OPTION 1: GITHUB BUILD (NO SETUP)
========================================

Upload your project to GitHub and let GitHub
build the APK for you automatically:

STEP 1: Create GitHub Account
-----------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com
2. Click "Sign up" (it's free)
3. Create account (takes 2 minutes)

STEP 2: Upload Your Project
---------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Name it: "EZY_Booking"
3. Click "uploading an existing file"
4. Drag your entire EZY_Booking folder
5. Click "Commit changes"

STEP 3: Auto-Build APK
----------------------
1. In your GitHub repo, click "Actions"
2. Click "set up a workflow yourself"
3. Replace everything with this:

name: Build APK
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'
    - name: Build APK
      run: ./gradlew assembleRelease
    - name: Upload APK
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: app-release
        path: app/build/outputs/apk/release/

4. Click "Commit changes"
5. GitHub builds your APK automatically!
6. Download from "Actions" tab

========================================
   OPTION 2: USE ONLINE BUILDER
========================================

1. Go to: https://www.apponline.co/android-app-maker
2. Upload your project
3. It builds APK online

========================================
   OPTION 3: SIMPLEST - USE OLD APK
========================================

You already have a working APK! Let's use it:

1. Take the existing APK: EZY_Booking_OLD.apk
2. Install it on your phone
3. Test if it works for basic functionality
4. While it has the old issues, it still forwards OTPs

Use this temporarily while we figure out building.

========================================
   OPTION 4: GET HELP FROM DEVELOPER
========================================

Find any Android developer who can build this for you:
- Local university computer science students
- Freelancer websites (Upwork, Fiverr)
- Ask on Reddit: r/androiddev

Just give them your EZY_Booking folder.
Building takes them 5 minutes.

========================================
         MY RECOMMENDATION
========================================

Try OPTION 1 (GitHub) - it's completely free
and requires ZERO software installation on your PC.

GitHub has professional build servers that will
compile your APK automatically.

This is actually how many professional developers
build their apps!

the GitHub method step-by-step?
